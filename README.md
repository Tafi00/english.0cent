This is the first project that I actually build on my own, to fulfill the dream of building something related to English and give value to the community.

It is a e-learning website where I design courses about grammar from zero to hero, vocabulary for conversational english and further free access course if any.

If i am lucky enough, I expect to run paid course to make this project help me pay the bill too.

Hope that helps, see you when it launches.
